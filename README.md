# TEXT_ANALYSIS_AND_SOCIAL_FEEDBACK_INSIGHTS_FOR_MULTI-PLATFORM_NEWS_DATASET

#Description:
This project focuses on analyzing the News Popularity in Multiple Social Media Platforms dataset. The analysis encompasses various tasks related to word frequency, news sentiment, social media feedback, and co-occurrence relationships across news data.

#Task Overview:
#Word Frequency Analysis:

Count and rank the most frequent words in the ‘Title’ and ‘Headline’ fields based on term frequency.
Analyze the most frequent words in total, per day, and per topic (economy, Microsoft, Obama, and Palestine).
#Social Media Popularity Analysis:

Calculate the average popularity of each news item by hour and by day for each platform (Facebook, Google+, and LinkedIn).
#Sentiment Score Analysis:

Compute the sum and average sentiment scores for each topic (economy, Microsoft, Obama, and Palestine) in the news data.
#Word Co-occurrence Matrices:

Generate co-occurrence matrices (100x100) for the top-100 frequent words per topic in the ‘Title’ and ‘Headline’ fields.
Each entry in the matrix represents the co-occurrence frequency of words within all news titles and headlines, respectively.
#Dataset:
The dataset, sourced from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, contains approximately 100,000 news items alongside their corresponding social media feedback data across three platforms: Facebook, Google+, and LinkedIn.
